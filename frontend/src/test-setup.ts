// package)" noise on every axe.run() in unit tests. jsdom already returns null

// does not have: its isModal/isFullscreen asserts call back into
// Element.matches, which re-enters nwsapi, and every failed probe unwinds
// through try/catch and re-descends, so one matches() call runs for minutes
// inside a single synchronous computation. Floating UI's positioning code
// calls element.matches(':modal') on every popover position pass while
// probing for top-layer elements (isTopLayer) and expects unsupported
// selectors to fail fast, so any test that opens a Base UI Popover blocks
// the event loop and hangs. jsdom has no fullscreen or modal top layer at
// all, so "not matched" is the correct answer for a bare top-layer
// pseudo-class; all other selectors keep using jsdom's normal matching.
// The Storybook project runs in a real browser and is unaffected.
